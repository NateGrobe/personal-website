                &emsp;Hi I'm Nate Grobe, a 2nd year software engineering student at Ontario Tech University. I love animals and have three dogs. In my free time I enjoy watching TV or movies, especially crime and comedy shows. I also enjoy playing a variety of videogames such as The Witcher or Super Smash Bro's. In the winter, I like to ski whenever possible and I do my best to make it out as often as I can.

                <br><br>

                &emsp;I grew up competing springboard and platform diving. I trained and competed for ten years and attended many major competitions such as Junior and Senior Nationals as well as a host of provincial level events and a few international events traveling as far as Cuba. I love the sport and still coach my own group of kids at the Toronto Pan American Sports Center in Scarborogh while in school.
